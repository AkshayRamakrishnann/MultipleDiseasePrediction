Welcome to My Doctor, a comprehensive web application designed to predict multiple diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease. My Doctor employs machine learning models to provide accurate predictions based on user-provided health metrics. This user-friendly system is equipped with dedicated sections for each disease, allowing users to input relevant details and receive instant predictions.

## Features

### Diabetes Prediction

Predict the likelihood of diabetes by entering key health metrics, including the number of pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age.

### Heart Disease Prediction

Determine the probability of heart disease by inputting various health parameters such as age, sex, chest pain types, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise, slope of the peak exercise ST segment, major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and thalassemia type.

### Parkinson's Disease Prediction

Predict the presence of Parkinson's disease by providing voice-related features, including MDVP:Fo (Hz), MDVP:Fhi (Hz), MDVP:Flo (Hz), MDVP:Jitter (%), MDVP:Jitter (Abs), MDVP:RAP, MDVP:PPQ, Jitter:DDP, MDVP:Shimmer, MDVP:Shimmer (dB), Shimmer:APQ3, Shimmer:APQ5, MDVP:APQ, Shimmer:DDA, NHR, HNR, RPDE, DFA, spread1, spread2, D2, and PPE.
